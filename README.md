# Letterboxd-Classification
Mulit-Class multi-Lable genre-prediction based on ~23k film posters (poster in, genres out). There are 19 different genres, e.g., "Drama" and "Family". Each film is assigned to at least one genre. 
The file "movie_data_cleaned.csv" contains data about the name of the movie, the link to the movie poster, the genres and other information. The right to the content is held by Letterboxd. 
I trained 2 different models for predicting the genre given the film poster. The first one is a plain CNN, containing 3 Convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers. The second one is ResNet18, based on the famous paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition". Both approaches use BCE as loss-function. Unfortunately, neither model is able to completely solve the problem: I overfitted one batch (64 images) for testing if the model is capable enough for the present data. This overfitted model reaches an accuracy of 85.7% for validation data. The model trained on all training data reaches 88.2%. Accuracy is defined here as correctly predicted genre, not correctly predicted images: If a poster's prediction has 10 of the 19 genres correct, the accuracy is 10/19. BUT, and thats the problem, if we just assign no genres in general, so each film poster contains to zero classes, we get an accuracy of ~88.1%
